# Demo LiteLLM

LiteLLM stands for Lightweight Large Language Model Library. It's an open-source Python library designed to simplify the use of various large language models (LLMs) from different providers.

## Here are some key features of LiteLLM:
- **Unified API**: LiteLLM provides a consistent interface for interacting with different LLMs. This eliminates the need to learn and use provider-specific APIs, saving you time and effort.
- **Supports Multiple Providers**: It can work with various LLM providers like OpenAI, Azure, Cohere, Hugging Face, and more. This gives you flexibility in choosing the LLM that best suits your needs.
- **Standardized Output**: LiteLLM ensures the responses from different LLMs are formatted consistently, making it easier to process and integrate results across various models.
- **Simplified Integration**: It helps streamline the integration of LLMs into your projects by providing a user-friendly way to call LLM functionalities like text completion and embedding generation.
